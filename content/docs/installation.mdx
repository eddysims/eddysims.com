description: How to install components from this registry.

import { Install } from "@/components/registry/install";

It doesn't matter what framework or package manager you are using. Installing components is as simple as running the `shadcn add` command followed by the URL to the component you want to install. This URL will always be formatted as `https://eddysims.com/r/<component-name>.json.`

The entire install process is handled by the shadcn CLI tool and works identically to how you would install any other Shadcn component.

## Example

Each component in this registry will have installation instructions. These will include instructions for installing via the shadcn CLI, as well as instructions for manually installing the component.
