title: Introduction
description: A collection of reusable React components, hooks, utilities and more.
---

Just like Shadcn, this is not a component library, but instead a collection of components, hooks, utilities and more that you can use to build your own projects.  These components are designed to be accessible and customizable, so you can easily integrate them into your projects.

Each component, hook, utility, etc. in this registry was built for a personal need. They each solve a specific problem that developers may face.

If there are any components that you would like added to this registry, or if you have any suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/eddysims/eddysims.com/issues/new?labels=enhancement).





{/* 
## Quick Start

Install components directly from this registry using the shadcn CLI:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://eddysims.com/r/rating
``` */}

{/* ## Available Components

Browse our collection of components:

<Cards>
  <Card title="Star Rating" href="/docs/components/star-rating" />
  <Card title="More components coming soon..." href="#" />
</Cards>

## How It Works

This registry uses the shadcn/ui registry system to distribute components. When you install a component:

1. The component files are copied to your project
2. Dependencies are automatically installed
3. You get full control over the code

## Features

- ðŸš€ **Easy Installation**: One command to install any component
- ðŸŽ¨ **Customizable**: Full control over styling and behavior
- ðŸ“š **Well Documented**: Each component comes with examples and API docs
- ðŸ”§ **TypeScript**: Built with TypeScript for better DX
- â™¿ **Accessible**: Components follow accessibility best practices

## Registry Structure

Components are organized in the following structure:

```
registry/
â”œâ”€â”€ new-york/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ rating/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ rating.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ public/r/
    â”œâ”€â”€ rating.json
    â””â”€â”€ ...
``` */}
