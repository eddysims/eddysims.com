description: A collection of reusable React components, hooks, utilities and more.

import { AvailableComponents } from "@/components/registry/available-components";

Just like Shadcn, this is not a component library, but instead a collection of components, hooks, utilities and more that you can use to build your own projects.  These components are designed to be accessible and customizable, so you can easily integrate them into your projects.

Each component, hook, utility, etc. in this registry was built for a personal need. They each solve a specific problem that developers may face.

If there are any components that you would like added to this registry, or if you have any suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/eddysims/eddysims.com/issues/new?labels=enhancement).
