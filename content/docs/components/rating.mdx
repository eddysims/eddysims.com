## Installation

<Install component="rating" />

## Props

<AutoTypeTable
  path="./registry/new-york/rating/components/rating.tsx"
  name="RatingProps"
/>

## Examples

### Form

Use the `Rating` component in a form to get the value of the rating.

<Demo component="rating" name="form" />

### Read-only

Use the `Rating` component in a read-only state to display the rating.

<Demo component="rating" name="readonly" />

## Styling

- To adjust the spacing between the stars, you will want to adjust the padding on the star, rather then the gap of the flex container. The reason for this is to avoid jittering the stars when hovering.
- To adjust the size or color of the stars, you will want to adjust the size of the star icon.

### Examples

<Demo component="rating" name="styling" />
